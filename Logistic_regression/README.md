# Logistic Regression Project

The purpose of this mini-project was to use logistic regression to classify men and women based on weight and height. It was a simple dataframe meant to illustrate the mechanics of logistic regression and its methods for differentiating between classes. Unlike linear regression, which predicts a continuous output based on linearly correlated predictors, logistic regression attempts to find the seperation line between classes in dimensional space. The data was split into test and train and the classifier used was Scikit-learns logistic regression. To improve our model we used 5-fold cross validation along with parameter grid tuning to determine the optimal regularization paramter. The final greatest accuracy achieved was a 92% with a regularization parameter of 1.
