# Linear Regression Mini-Project

This project looked at data from the Boston department of housing to determine the most influential factors contributing to property value. Exploratory data analysis revealed a number of correlated variables, among them being the number of bedrooms, the teacher to student ratio in that district and the crime rate. Features were checked for correlation against each other and against the prediction variable to root out redundant and non-linearly related features, and outliers and high leverage points were dropped prior to making the final predictions. To evaluate the model, the coefficient of determination (R^2) was used to identify what percentage of variance in the response variable could be explained by the model. The downsides to this are that it can artificially increase with additional predictors, which were carefully chosen as a result. Along with R^2, the F-statistic was used to determine how statistically significant our results were. The final model produced an R^2 of 0.69, up from 0.59 and an F-statistic of 368.2, up from 245.2.
