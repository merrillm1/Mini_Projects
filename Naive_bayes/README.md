# Naive Bayes Text Classification Project

In this mini project I attempted to classify a movie review as rotten or fresh based on text analysis of the review. For the model a naive bayes classifier called Multinomial Naive Bayes was used. This is because the likelihood function takes the form of a multinomial distribution. Our model is based on word counts taken from a lexicon created from all reviews in the set. Parameter tuning was performed to choose the optimal max and min degrees of freedom, which determine the minimum and maximum number of times a word may appear for it to be included in the lexicon. MultinomialNB also takes an alpha parameter which helps avoid zeros in the probability computations. The max and min features were chosen by looking at the ECDF of the document frequencies and the alpha parameter was chosen by running cross validation over different values. The final result was an accuracy of 74%. Next steps here would be to implement different classifiers such as TF-IDF which weights each term by the inverse of its popularity in all documents.
