# Prep Course Capstone

This project was completed as part of a preparatory course for Springboards Data Science career track. The goal of the project is to determine if Apple store apps received better ratings than Google store apps. The data was downloaded from Kaggle and included two seperate sets, one for each of the platforms. Appropriate cleaning steps were taken for each data frame including removing rows with nan values from any apps without at least one rating.

To determine which platform received better ratings, the mean for each was compared and the difference was in favor of the Google app store. To determine if this was statistically significant, a permutation test was implemented with a significance level of 0.05. A permutation test was necessary due to the heavily skewed nature of the app ratings for both Google and Apple. Our null hypothesis was that the app store platform had no influence on overall ratings, with our alternative being that it does. After performing the permutation test our p-value was virtually zero, meaning that the observed difference was significant. It was then concluded that the platform does have an impact on ratings and that Google play has a better overall average among apps.
